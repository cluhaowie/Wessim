Simexon basically generates a set of *artificial* DNA fragments for next generation sequencing (NGS) read simulation. In the targeted resequencing, we constraint the genomic regions that are used to generated DNA fragments to be only a part of the entire genome; they are usually exons and/or a few introns and untranslated regions (UTRs).\r\n\r\n### Install Simexon\r\nTo run Simexon, Python 2.7 or later is required. To install Python, go to http://python.org/\r\n\r\nDownload Simexon using the links in this page, or go to https://github.com/sak042/Simexon\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThe following programs are required to run Simexon or to prepare input files:\r\n* **pysam** library: go to http://code.google.com/p/pysam/ to install pysam\r\n* **numpy** library: go to http://numpy.scipy.org/ to install numpy\r\n* **gfServer** and **gfClient**: In probe hybridization mode, Simexon runs more than 100,000 queries again the reference genome. This essentially requires a local blat server. gfServer and gfClient are pre-compiled programs for establishing private blat server on your computer. go to http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ to download gfServer and gfClient (and set your local path to access the two programs anywhere). For more details about the tools, please refer to http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat5\r\n* **faToTwoBit**: go to http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ and download faToTwoBit. This is required to convert your FASTA file to .2bit \r\n* **samtools**: samtools is needed to index your sample genome FASTA file (samtools faidx).\r\n* **GemSim** error models: Simexon uses GemSim's empirical error models for NGS read generation. Go to GemSim's project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gemsim/) to download GemSim. You will find several model files (e.g. ill100v4_p.gzip) under 'models' directory. Save them and remember their location.\r\n \r\n### Preparing Input Files \r\nSimexon requires two major inputs. One is the sample genome sequence, and the other is the target region information.\r\n* Sample genome sequence: This is a FASTA file (e.g. ref.fa). You will need to index the file and generate .2bit \r\n    * samtools faidx ref.fa\r\n    * faToTwoBit ref.fa ref.2bit \r\n* Target region information: Target regions can be specified by two different ways. \r\n    * Ideal target mode: In ideal target mode, you will provide a list of genomic coordinates in a BED file (e.g. chr1   798833 799125). Ideal targets of major exome capture platforms are freely available from vendor's website. For Agilent's SureSelect platforms, go to https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/ , For NimbleGen's SeqCap go to http://www.nimblegen.com/products/seqcap/index.html and find BED files under Design and Annotation Files. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile.
